    View controllers that need to present a sequence of modal view controllers

    cannot transition nicely into another modal view controller. One modal view
    controller needs to be dismissed first and then the second one is presented.
    This protocol enables modal view controllers to present one over the other and than
    when the sequence of modal view controllers is over, the last one calls readyToDismiss()
